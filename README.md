## 🧭 About Me
I’m a geospatial data leader and advocate for efficient, transparent data systems. My background bridges geoscience workflows, energy data systems, and enterprise GIS with modern data engineering and integration practices — all aimed at building smooth, scalable, and reliable data ecosystems.

When not wrangling data or improving metadata governance, I’m exploring Colorado with my family, on pedals, a board, my feet or with paddle.
